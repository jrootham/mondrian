    <h1>Mondrian</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Mondrian is a test bed/example for branching undo/redo (or zero effort 
      version control).  It is about the simplest possible application that
      could demonstrate the utility of better undo/redo.
    </p>
    <h3>Trial Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      To try it out, first use the add button to create some rectangles, then
      drag the right quadrants to move (upper left) and resize (lower right) 
      them and click on the upper right quadrant to change their colout.  If 
      you create too many you can click on a lower left quadrant to delete them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by creating a few coloured blocks.  Then use the undo button to 
      return to earlier states.  Do that a few times, and then use the undo and 
      redo buttons to navigate from one state to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you click on the history window button you can see the complete history
      of all the commands you have executed. In the default state if you hover 
      over a command square (either directly or in the magnify window) you will
      see the corresponding state in the context window.  If you click on a 
      command window you will be sent back to the application in the state
      at that point. 
    </p>
    <h3>Device Tailoring</h3>
    <p>
      If you are on a tablet device without the ability to hover, click the 
      "No hover" checkbox.  With that set you must click on a command box 
      in the history window to see
      the state and use the "Revert" button on the context window to return to
      that state.
    </p>
    <h3>Storage Information</h3>
    <p>
      This application uses local storage.  I did this to avoid having to 
      implement user authentication on the server.  This does mean if you move
      the code to another location the data will not move with it.
      I include a simple 
      local storage manager so the data can be deleted if desired.  
      I believe it may possible to
      run without a connection if all the code is cached.
    </p>

      The point of this application is to experiment with different UI features
      for navigating in an undo/redo tree.  Please feel free to comment at
